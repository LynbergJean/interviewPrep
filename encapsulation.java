/*

it means wrapping up the implementation of the data members and methods in a class.

can often be confused with abstration:
which is hiding unecessary details and only showing necessary information
you have a car and you put in the ignition and start the car you cannot see the process that goes on
behind the scene into starting the car you cant really see how the fuel injector is working 
you cannot see the process that goes into the radiator you can only see that you started the car.

you dont need to know all these unecessary details to start the car.

abstraction is solving a design level issue and encapsulation is solving a implementation level issue
and hides the entire code into a single entity and protects it from the world.

abstratcion is a method of gaining information and encapsulation is a process of containing  the info.

in abstratction we can use the interfaces.

encapsulation is putting data in a bundle and hding it from the world.
