difference between functional, precedural and OOP languages

-prog languages are what we use to tell a computer to do specific things

procedural
	-its imperative is to write step by step execution, the program's logic is driven by control flow.
	an example is c, Go.

functional 
	-declarative, expression based
	Programs are built by composing pure functions — functions with no side effects and no 
	reliance on shared data.

Object oriented
	-Logic is distributed across objects that maintain their own state and behavior.
	examples are Java, C++, C#

	key characterisitics of OOP are:
	encapsulation:
		- hiding the internal state of a program.

	inheritance:
		-sharing behavior through class hierarchies
	
	abstraction:
		-giving users access to only what is required.

	polymorphism: 
		-Same interface, different behavior


an object is Code + data.

static vs Dynamic languages

Static: 
	-performs type checking at compile time
	-errors will show at compile time
	-declare the datatype before you use it
	-more control

Dynamic:
	-performs type checking at runtime.
	-error will not be shown till the program is ran.
	-new need to declare datatypes of variables.
	-helps save time when writing error but might give error at run time.


Strong vs weakly typed languages
		- how strict does the language enforce data types.

	Strong: 
	-you cannot mix incompatible types.
	python, java, c#

	weak:
 	-you can somtimes coerce data types.
	c, c++, javaScript


a stack is a type of mem that is automatically being used and managed by the CPU / compiler
while a heap is mem that is controlled by the programmer and can be allocated and deallocated or garbage a 
garbage collector.

a variable in stack memory. 
java uses pass by reference variable.

Garbage Collector.
when there is no reference variable to an oject the garbage collector goes and frees that memory.
