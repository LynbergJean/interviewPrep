/*
types of polymorphism
compile time/static polymorphism
this can be achieved via method overloading.


Dynamic polymorphism/ runtime polymorphism 
achieved via method overriding

when a child class has the same method has the parent class and we call the child class's method 
this is called @overrriding. when overriding the parent method.

@override is to check if a method is overriden or not they are used for check purposes.

Parent object = new child;
the method that will be called will depend of the type of child and this is know as UPCASTING and
this is also known as Upcasting;

Dynamic method Dispatch: 

Final is used to create constants and can be used to prevent overriding.
you cannot override a method that is final they provide enhencement. this is called early binding and 
late binding.
when you put a class as final you also declare its methods as final also.

a static method is a method that is object independant.
inside a static method everything inside has to be static as well. 
no we cannot override a static method. the one in the main class is the one that is being called 
static methods can be inherited but they cannot be overriden static is object independ hence why
they cannot be overriden but they can be inherited.

you can inherit but you cannot override
